  üìù About the project
</h2>
<p>
  This project is a visualization of five different sorting algorithms using different pictures of nature. It shows how five different sorting methods (<b>Bubble Sort</b>, <b>Insertion Sort</b>, <b>Selection Sort</b>, <b>Heap Sort</b>, and <b>Quick Sort</b>) work using pictures. Although this is a more fun way of visualizing sorting algorithms, it is not the best visualization method when it comes to learning. It features 10 pictures of nature that can be sorted by pressing buttons with a desired sorting algorithm.

  üîë How it works
</h2>
<p>
  The project is written in Python using pygame library. Firstly, a random image is loaded. In order to cut the image into the bars, function <b>pygame.Surface.blit()</b> is used. Each image is 1100 pixels wide and split into bars that are 2 pixels wide. In order to use the sorting algorithms, first we need a list of numbers. In this case we store starting position of each bar in a list. This way we can easily sort the starting positions of each bar and visualize the process.

<h2>
  üìñ Getting Started
</h2>
<p>
  Requirements: Python and pygame (Python package)
</p>
<p>
  In order to start the program, you have to download the File <b>Picture Sorter Visualization</b>. It is very important that the following files are all in the same directory: <b>main.py</b>, <b>Pictures</b> and <b>Fonts</b>. The easiest method is just to download the File <b>Picture Sorter Visualization</b>.
</p>
<h2>
  üî® How to use
</h2>
<p>
  After executing the program you will see a window with random unsorted picture of a nature. In order to see the sorting visualization process, you need to press a button selecting your desired sorting algorithm. After that all you need to do is press the button 'Sort' and the sorting process will start. During the sorting process you can not pause it and you need to wait until the end of the process. After that you may reset the image or you can select next random picture of nature to sort.

  üìú Credits
</h2>

In order to get a general idea of how to visualize sorting algorithms in Python I have watched video tutorials from [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/@TechWithTim). With the help of [Clear Code](https://www.youtube.com/@ClearCode) I have managed to implement animated buttons.
